    JSPM/SystemJS does not guarantee load order, so there is a good chance that
    you will not be able to override 3rd party styles when you expect to.

    The workaround is to wrap all styles in this selector to make them more
    specific than 3rd party css selectors.

    Note that the <html> tag in index.html is given the id="myapp" so that this
    selector pertains to everything in the html document.
